                            10.Staring at the ceiling, counting endless sheep Your lies unfold, secrets run deep A masquerade, a well-played charade A love so fragile, easily frayed
                                (Chorus) Dead game, a losing fight A broken heart, a shattered light The truth unveiled, a bitter pill A love once pure, now cold and still
                                (Verse 2) A vacant smile, a hollow gaze A heart of stone, in twisted ways A web of deceit, a tangled mess A love betrayed, a soul distressed
                                (Chorus) Dead game, a losing fight A broken heart, a shattered light The truth unveiled, a bitter pill A love once pure, now cold and still
                                (Bridge) I'll cut the strings, break the chains No more illusions, no more pains I'll rise above, a phoenix reborn A new beginning, a brighter morn
                                (Chorus) Dead game, a losing fight A broken heart, a shattered light The truth unveiled, a bitter pill A love once pure, now cold and still
